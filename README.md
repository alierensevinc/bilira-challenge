# React-Native Developer - Code Challenge

## Objective

Develop a mobile application that connects to the Binance API (or another market API) to fetch and display asset data in a live-updating list.

## Features

- **API Integration:** Connect to the Binance API or any other market API to fetch asset data.
- **Live Data Updates:** Implement real-time updates for asset data.
- **Price Change Highlighting:**
  - Red for a decrease in value (flashing for one second).
  - Green for an increase in value (flashing for one second).
- **Splash Screen:** Display a splash screen when the app is launched.
- **Home Screen:** Display a list of assets with live data.
- **Asset Detail Screen (Optional):**
  - Display asset price and a chart with a timescale.
  - Show market stats and 24h sparkline chart (green if positive, red if negative).

## Technical Requirements

- **List Display:**

  - Include asset icon, name, symbol, and live data such as price and 24h change.
  - Implement infinite scrolling to load more assets as the user scrolls.
  - Highlight price and 24h change using appropriate colors based on their value.

- **Project Setup:**

  - Follow the recommended React Native setup flow.
  - Ensure the project is set up with TypeScript.

- **Code Quality:**

  - Adhere to SOLID principles.
  - Maintain consistent and meaningful naming conventions.
  - Include comprehensive code documentation.

- **Testing:**
  - Implement unit tests for critical components and functions.

## Submission

- Provide a public GitHub repository link with the complete source code.
- Include a README with setup instructions and other relevant information.
- Publish a small demo on Expo.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness and completeness of the functionality.
- Focus on best practices, code quality, readability, and documentation (JSDoc, README).
- Efficient use of TypeScript.
- Proper implementation of live data updates with visual feedback.
